<h2>SWT example - Browser Demos</h2>

<p>
The Browser Demos demonstrate various features of the SWT Browser widget. 
</p><p>The Pawns Game is a board game that can be played against the computer
or against another player. Rendering is based on HTML and CSS techniques. The
board is a table filled with hyperlinks. Cascading Style Sheets
provide various themes and control the table aesthetic appearance.
The API <code>org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.setText(java.lang.String)</code> draws
the board game from HTML generated in memory.
Player moves are captured by implementing the interface <code>org.eclipse.swt.browser.LocationListener</code>.
e.g the player clicks on a cell that may generate an hyperlink with a URL similar to
http://www.org.eclipse.swt.examples.browser.demos/xx1yy2. That hyperlink identifies
the position of the cell selected by the player. The move is completed by generating
new HTML content and invoking <code>Browser.setText</code> to update the board game.
